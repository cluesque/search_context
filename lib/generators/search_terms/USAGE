    rails generate search_terms <context>

The <context> is the both the context of the words (ie, names) and the table that is used to store them in the database. Typically you only need one context, and the default name is 'search_terms', so you would type: 

    rails g search_terms
    
That will generate the search_terms migration + model.

If you want, you can add additional fields to the search terms table, so that you can scope the terms by some other attribute, like here:

  rails g search_terms slang country_id:integer
