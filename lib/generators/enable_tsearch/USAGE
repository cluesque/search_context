    rails generate enable_tsearch <table> <context> <col1> <col2> ...

This assumes that you have already created a search_context using 'rails g search_context ...' and want to enable using that search_context from this related model.

This would generate the following

1. migration to add a context_vector column to table
2. migration to create a trigger that updates the context_vector column from <col1> <col2> ... whenever <table> is inserted or updated.

The migration to create the trigger is only an example, it'll work for simple cases but you'd need to edit it to create more complex and useful triggers, for example
if you needed to join to a remote table to get some columns from there.
